The eight edition of Core Data by Tutorials is out! This edition is compatible with Swift 5.3 and iOS 14.

I can’t believe it’s been six years of book updates over six versions of iOS and five versions of Swift. Core Data continues to be a great choice for persisting and querying a complex object graph on Apple’s platforms.

I'm very grateful for our outstanding book team: Matthew Morey, Aaron Douglas, Darren Ferguson and Richard Turton.
