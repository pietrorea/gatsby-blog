Good news — Core Data by Tutorials launched yesterday in PDF format. The book is written in Swift and it covers everything from the fundamentals up to the new iOS 8 APIs. The whole process was a great team effort and I’m very happy that it’s finally out in the world.

Personally I prefer following a tutorial step by step rather than listening to a lecture or reading a book. I’ve always been a fan of learning by doing, especially if I’m starting from scratch.

Here’s a link to the announcement on Ray’s site. Also [here’s](http://www.raywenderlich.com/85578/first-core-data-app-using-swift) a sneak preview of chapter 1 in blog post form. I hope you guys enjoy the book.
