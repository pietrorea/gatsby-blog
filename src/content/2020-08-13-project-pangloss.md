**Note:** This page is under construction! The page is published but not linked from anywhere. I'm currently gathering feedback and making changes. **Pangloss** means “all languages” in Greek and is an overly optimistic character in Voltaire’s Candide. To be “Panglossian” means to be characterized or given to extreme optimism, especially in the face of hardship or adversity.


As of 2015, there are 53 million Spanish speakers in the United States. This alone makes the United States the second largest concentration of Spanish speakers in the world, after Mexico. Of this number, the majority are immigrants or recent immigrants from other countries.

Although the United States has no official language, the language of politics and business is English. The ability to get a job, to get an education and to interact with local authorities requires an adequate level of English proficiency. For millions of Spanish speakers in the United States, the ability to learn English well in all its modalities (writing, speaking, reading) is directly tied to economic advancement.

At the same time, the advances in consumer technology of the past decade have not been properly deployed in service of language learners. If you consider platforms like Facebook and Twitter, they provide engaging, hyper-personalized experiences (based on a deep knowledge of users) largely through mobile devices. This kind of platform still needs to be built for English ESL and for second language acquisition in general.
The motivation for this project centers around the intersection of language learning and economic opportunity but also understands that bilingualism in isolation is itself a public good. Access to another culture’s public discourse and art enriches private lives and advances cross cultural empathy and understanding.

## Project Pangloss  

ESL as it relates to economic opportunity in the United States is a huge and persistent problem. Pangloss is the codename for a project that seeks to deploy existing technologies and best practices in service of language learners. This is how Pangloss is different:

### Culturally-anchored

The United States has immigrants from all over the world. A common problem faced by Spanish speaking ESL students is that they are put into courses and classrooms with non Spanish speakers. This means English is used to teach English. Pangloss will always introduce English in the learner’s L1 (Spanish) when appropriate.

Going a step further, all material should be anchored in culture or at least be culturally-relevant. In this case, materials will be unique to the experience of a Spanish speaker living in the United States. In practice, this means that that materials will tend to be more practical and goal-oriented (e.g. going to the bank, meeting with a child’s teacher, registering to vote).

### Personalized

As the learner keeps using Pangloss, the platform builds a deep understanding about what the learner knows and doesn’t know to introduce new vocabulary and grammar in the right amounts at the right time. 

That the learner can use Pangloss a la carte, choosing which modules to review, but  the best experience comes from letting the platform surface timely content for your specific needs.

### Engaging

Social media platforms have come up with a highly engaging recipe for getting people to come back to their platforms over and over. Even when there’s only couple of minutes available while waiting in line, people pick up their phones to check their Instagram feed or Facebook feeds. 

What if the same methods could be applied to learning a second language? The language learning content has to both educate and engage at a level that makes people come back again and again. This means the material also has to be bite-sized.

### Integrated

Pangloss seeks to integrate the liberal arts with technology in new and innovative ways for the goal of English SLA. It's not enough to distribute engaging and personalized language learning material online. We don't need more blogs and YouTubers that tackle the subject. We do need a deeply considered, integrated platform that melds content with technology. We're almost talking about creating new mediums and types of media for the purpose of learning a new language.

Integration also refers to taking an integrated, holistic, look at the learner. Learning a language does not happen in isolation. In particular, when you’re learning the primary language spoken around you, there is a certain level of fear and uncertainty. An integrated approach takes in the learner’s personality, psychology and learning styles into consideration.

### Free

The need for culturally-anchored, personalized, engaging, technologically-leveraged ESL in the United States is enormous. The bulk of Pangloss should always be free to use, with sustainable upgrades to maintain and improve Pangloss.

### For the long term

Pangloss should be self-sustaining and have a very long time horizon in mind. Language learning as it relates to economic advancement is a huge, persistent problem that requires a long term visions and goals. Keeping a long time horizon in mind needs to act as a north star when bringing in partners and sustaining business models. 

## Open questions:

*  What’s the role of teachers? Can teachers be brought on to Pangloss at some point? Can Pangloss be used to augment existing language learning classrooms?
* Should Pangloss produce all of its learning content? Should it license it or seek outside contributors?
