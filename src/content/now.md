Here’s what I’m currently working on (last updated Aug 13, 2020):

- As of this writing, I'm one week into my new job at Capital One. After almost exactly three years at [Upside](https://upside.com), I joined Capital One's mobile engineering team to work on their iOS app. After a couple years doing full stack web development, this is a nice return to Swift and native mobile development. 
- I’m on the lookout for a new programming side project. I’m in the early stages of research for a new side project. It’s likely going to be a Chinese dictionary app for iOS.
- I’m getting back to playing the violin for my own enjoyment. The last song I learned how to play is [Rains of Castamere](https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0188250) from GoT.

## Books I’m reading

I’m not a voracious reader, although I would like to become one. At any point in time I’m likely reading a book from [Alan Kay’s reading list](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp), a technical book  and some fiction. I’m currently reading:

- "The Secret of Childhood" by Maria Montessori
- "El obsceno pájaro" de la noche by José Donoso
- [Effective TypeScript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-typescript/9781492053736/) by [Dan Vanderkam](https://www.danvk.org/)
- [A Farewell to Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms) by Ernest Hemingway
