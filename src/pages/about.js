      <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Hello üëã, my name is Pietro Rea and I am a software developer, team lead and author living in northern Virginia. Over the years I‚Äôve discovered that I am a <a href="https://medium.com/@sherifmansour/product-engineers-f424da766871">product engineer</a>, which means I engage with the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, build MLPs (minimum lovable products) and pair up well with product, UX and design. </p>

        <p>I‚Äôve worked on mobile development since iOS 4 and I‚Äôm a big proponent of the mobile form factor and its untapped potential. I‚Äôve also been a lead engineer, tech lead and people manager for mobile and full-stack engineering teams. The wonderful feeling you get when you're part of a good group of humans makes me tick and I‚Äôm driven to to find it and to build it. </p>

        <p>Words sometimes leak out of me and make their way into books and articles, mostly about software development on Apple platforms. I love language learning and promote multilingualism as a public good. I am a native Spanish speaker and a student of Chinese. I‚Äôm married to Emily and together we have two wonderful kids.</p>

        <h2>What I&#39;ve done before</h2>

        <p>I&#39;ve held a number of team leadership and senior engineering positions across many industries including travel, e-commerce an media. Right now I work on Capital One‚Äôs mobile engineering team where I help build digital tools for their mobile customers.</p>

        <p>Previously, I was a team lead at <a href="https://upside.com">Upside Business Travel</a>, a startup focused on building solutions for the unique problems of business travelers and their employers. While I was there I hired engineers for Upside&#39;s mobile and full stack teams and together we built Upside&#39;s corporate offering. </p>

        <p>Prior to joining Upside, I started a mobile-focused software development agency called Sweetpea Mobile, where I helped startups like <a href="https://www.gc.com">GameChanger</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/spotify-acquires-content-recommendation-startup-mightytv/">MightyTV</a> with their mobile apps. I was a one-man show for most engagements and hired contractors for others. I operated as an agency for almost two years until I ramped down operations in 2017. Sweetpea Mobile is dormant but active! Reach out if you think I can help you.</p>

        <p>Before Sweetpea Mobile, I was a mobile engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapers.com">Quidsi</a>, the parent company for Diapers.com, Soap.com and several other e-commerce brands. As a team, we mastered the art of ‚Äúone-handed shopping‚Äù, shipping five-star iOS and Android apps that enabled parents to get all their shopping done with one hand while an infant was in the other. Quidsi was a subsidiary of Amazon so I also worked on multiple platform integration projects. And before Quidsi, I worked in the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a> newsroom in New York City where I built news and video apps.</p>

        <p>I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Economics from Princeton University. I decided on my major after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worldly-Philosophers-Economic-Thinkers-Seventh/dp/068486214X">The Worldly Philosophers</a> by Robert Heilbroner, although I spent most of my time at Princeton studying Chinese and Computer Science. ‰Ω†Â•Ω!</p>
